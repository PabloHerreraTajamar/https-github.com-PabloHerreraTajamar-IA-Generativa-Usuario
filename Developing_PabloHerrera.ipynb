    "A guardrail is a set of rules and checks designed to ensure that the outputs of an LLM are accurate, appropriate, and aligned with user expectations.

    "\n",
    "When building out our hallucination guardrail, here are some guiding principles:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Provide very descriptive metrics to evaluate whether a response is accurate\n",
    "- It is important to break down this idea of \"truth\" in easily identifiable metrics that we can measure\n",
    "- Metrics like truthfulness and relevance are difficult to measure. Giving concrete ways to score the statement can result in a more accurate guardrail\n",
    "2. Ensure consistency across key terminology\n",
    "- It is important to keep relevant terms such as knowledge base articles, assistants, and users consistent across the prompt\n",
    "- If we begin to use phrases such as assistant vs agent, the model could get confused\n",
    "3. Start with the most advanced model\n",
    "- There is a cost vs quality trade-off when using the most advanced models. Although GPT-4o may be more expensive, it is important to start with the most advanced model so we can ensure a high degree of accuracy\n",
    "- Once we have thoroughly tested out the guardrail and are confident in its performance, we can look to reducing cost by tuning it down to gpt-3.5-turbo\n",
    "4. Evaluate each sentence independently and the entire response as a whole\n",
    "- If the agent returns a long response, it can be useful to break down the response to individual sentences and evaluate them independently\n",
    "- In addition to that, evaluating the whole intent of the message as a whole can ensure that you don't lose important context\n",
    "\n",
    "With all of this in mind, let's build out a guardrail system and measure its performance."

    "    1. Knowledge Accuracy: Does the message accurately reflect information found in the knowledge base? Assess not only direct mentions but also contextually inferred knowledge.\n",
    "    2. Relevance: Does the message directly address the user's question or statement? Check if the response logically follows the user’s last message, maintaining coherence in the conversation thread.\n",
    "    3. Policy Compliance: Does the message adhere to company policies? Evaluate for subtleties such as misinformation, overpromises, or logical inconsistencies. Ensure the response is polite, non-discriminatory, and practical.\n",
    "\n",
    "To perform your task you will be given the following:\n",
    "    1. Knowledge Base Articles - These are your source of truth for verifying the content of assistant messages.\n",
    "    2. Chat Transcript - Provides context for the conversation between the user and the assistant.\n",
    "    3. Assistant Message - The message from the assistant that needs review.\n",

    "For each sentence in the assistant's most recent response, assign a score based on the following criteria:\n",
    "    1. Factual Accuracy:\n",
    "        - Score 1 if the sentence is factually correct and corroborated by the knowledge base.\n",
    "        - Score 0 if the sentence contains factual errors or unsubstantiated claims.\n",
    "    2. Relevance:\n",
    "        - Score 1 if the sentence directly and specifically addresses the user's question or statement without digression.\n",
    "        - Score 0 if the sentence is tangential or does not build logically on the conversation thread.\n",
    "    3. Policy Compliance:\n",
    "        - Score 1 if the response complies with all company policies including accuracy, ethical guidelines, and user engagement standards.\n",
    "        - Score 0 if it violates any aspect of the policies, such as misinformation or inappropriate content.\n",
    "    4. Contextual Coherence:\n",
    "        - Score 1 if the sentence maintains or enhances the coherence of the conversation, connecting logically with preceding messages.\n",
    "        - Score 0 if it disrupts the flow or context of the conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Include in your response an array of JSON objects for each evaluated sentence. Each JSON object should contain:\n",
    "    - `sentence`: Text of the evaluated sentence.\n",
    "    - `factualAccuracy`: Score for factual correctness (0 or 1).\n",
    "    - `factualReference`: If scored 1, cite the exact line(s) from the knowledge base. If scored 0, provide a rationale.\n",
    "    - `relevance`: Score for relevance to the user’s question (0 or 1).\n",
